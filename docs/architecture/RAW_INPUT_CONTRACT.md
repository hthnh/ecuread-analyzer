# RAW Input Contract

This contract describes input formats accepted by this repository today.

Architecture rule:

```text
Analyzer owns ECU semantic decoding.
Transport representations normalize into native ECU frames before semantic decoding.
Cloud may validate payload shape, IDs, hashes, hex encoding, and persistence
contracts, but Cloud must not contain Honda signal byte mappings.
```

## Public Input Surfaces

| Surface | Input | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/v1/analysis` | JSON `CanonicalTelemetrySession` | Preferred path. This is not RAW ingestion. |
| `POST /api/v1/raw/decode-analyze` | JSON RAW frame session | Production ESP RAW path. Returns canonical V2 plus analysis. |
| `POST /api/v1/sessions` | Multipart file plus form metadata | RAW compatibility path. |
| `POST /api/v1/import/raw-session` | Multipart file plus form metadata | Same processor as `/sessions`, explicitly named for raw import. |
| `import_raw_text(text, settings, **metadata)` | Legacy text content | Python API. |
| `import_raw_file(path, settings, **metadata)` | Legacy text or JSONL file | Python API with file auto-detection. |
| `parse_log_file(path)` | Legacy text or JSONL file | Parser-level API. |

`parse_log_file` treats a file as JSONL when either:

- the extension is `.jsonl`, or
- the first non-blank line starts with `{`.

Otherwise it uses legacy text parsing.

## RAW JSON Decode/Analyze API

Endpoint:

```text
POST /api/v1/raw/decode-analyze
```

This is the Cloud-to-Analyzer HTTP contract for ESP sessions that contain RAW
frames. The endpoint accepts a complete ordered session of up to 5,000 records
and returns:

```text
canonical_session: canonical-telemetry-v2
analysis: AnalysisService summary
```

Request shape:

```json
{
  "session_id": "ecu-abc-raw-000001",
  "device_id": "ecu-abc",
  "vehicle_id": null,
  "raw_representation": "legacy29_ff5",
  "sampling": {"sample_interval_ms": 250},
  "records": [
    {"sequence": 0, "timestamp_ms": 0, "raw_hex": "FFFFFFFFFF02187117..."}
  ],
  "process_with_model": true
}
```

Supported `raw_representation` values:

| Value | Input rule | Normalization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `legacy29_ff5` | exactly 29 bytes and first five bytes are `FF FF FF FF FF` | strip the five-byte prefix |
| `native24_table17` | exactly 24 bytes | use as native frame |

After normalization, all semantic decoding uses
`honda_keihin_71_17:1.0.0`. The legacy 29-byte prefix is transport
compatibility only and has no signal meaning.

Native validation:

```text
length == 24
header == 02 18 71 17
sum(frame) % 256 == 0
```

Malformed per-record frames are preserved as invalid canonical samples when the
request envelope itself is valid. This allows mixed sessions to return valid and
invalid samples together. Small sessions that cannot produce ML windows still
return an analysis summary with `overall_status="no_windows"` or `not_scored`.

## RAW Upload Metadata

The RAW HTTP endpoints accept these form fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | upload file | yes | non-empty; size <= `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` (default 25). |
| `device_id` | string | no, except with client `session_id` | Required when client `session_id` is supplied. |
| `vehicle_id` | string | no | Stored as metadata. |
| `sample_interval_ms` | float | no | Must be positive if supplied. |
| `sampling_rate_hz` | float | no | Must be positive if supplied. |
| `session_note` | string | no | Stored as metadata. |
| `firmware_version` | string | no | Stored as metadata. |
| `session_id` | string | no | Client idempotency key; regex `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,127}$`. |
| `process_with_model` | bool | no | Default `true`; when false, feature extraction runs but inference is skipped. |

When `device_id` and client `session_id` are supplied, uploads are idempotent by
SHA-256. The same payload reuses the existing result. A different payload for
the same `(device_id, session_id)` returns HTTP 409.

## Legacy Text RAW Format

Parser: `app.ingestion.raw_ecu.parser.parse_log_text`

Accepted frame markers:

```text
RAW: FF;FF;FF;FF;FF;02;18;71;17;...
```

or:

```text
RAW:
FF;FF;FF;FF;FF;02;18;71;17;...
```

Rules:

- Marker is case-insensitive and must match `RAW:`.
- Non-RAW lines are ignored.
- If `RAW:` has an empty payload, the next non-blank line is used as payload.
- Payload tokens are split by semicolon.
- Tokens must be 1 or 2 hexadecimal characters.
- Exactly 29 bytes are required.
- One-character tokens such as `2` are accepted and decoded as `0x02`.
- Frame index is the zero-based order of discovered RAW frames.
- Legacy text does not carry per-frame timestamps.

Malformed legacy frames are preserved in `ParseResult.frames` with:

- `parse_ok=false`
- `parse_error=<reason>`
- `checksum_valid=false`

Legacy text uploads are rejected only when no RAW frames are found. If malformed
legacy frames exist, the pipeline may still proceed, but ML validation later
requires enough eligible samples.

## ESP JSONL RAW Format

Parser: `app.ingestion.raw_ecu.parser.parse_jsonl_file`

Each non-blank line must be a JSON object. Required payload field:

| Field | Type | Required | Semantics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `raw_hex` | string | yes | ECU frame bytes as compact hex or separated hex tokens. |

Optional fields used by parser:

| Field | Type | Semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `elapsed_ms` | numeric or numeric string | First-priority timestamp. |
| `timestamp_ms` | numeric or numeric string | Second-priority timestamp. |
| `device_time_ms` | numeric or numeric string | Third-priority timestamp. |
| `raw_length` | numeric or numeric string | If present, must equal parsed `raw_hex` byte count. |

Timestamp field priority is:

```text
elapsed_ms -> timestamp_ms -> device_time_ms
```

`raw_hex` accepted encodings:

- compact hex: `0218711703151900...`
- optional leading `0x` or `0X` for compact strings
- separated tokens using whitespace, semicolon, comma, tab, or newline
- separated tokens may individually use `0x`/`0X`

Frame-length rules:

| Parsed length | Accepted? | Conversion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 24 bytes | yes | Prepends five `FF` bytes for legacy 29-byte compatibility. |
| 29 bytes with first five bytes `FF FF FF FF FF` | yes | Used as-is. |
| 29 bytes without five-`FF` prefix | no | Parse error. |
| Other length | no | Parse error. |

Malformed JSONL uploads are rejected before committing raw files or session
entities. The error reports up to the first three failed lines.

Examples of rejected JSONL conditions:

- malformed JSON
- line is not a JSON object
- missing/non-string/empty `raw_hex`
- non-hex `raw_hex`
- odd-length compact hex
- invalid 24/29-byte length
- `raw_length` mismatch
- non-numeric timestamp or `raw_length`

## Checksum Rules

### Current Runtime Legacy 29-Byte Compatibility

Module: `app.ingestion.raw_ecu.checksum`

```python
len(frame) == 29
sum(frame) % 256 == 251
expected_checksum = (251 - sum(frame[:28])) % 256
actual_checksum = frame[28]
```

Checksum-invalid frames are decoded into rows only when the frame parses, but
they are not ML-eligible. Default window settings reject any window with checksum
failure ratio above `0.0`.

### Audited 24-Byte Honda/Keihin `0x71/0x17` Profile

Module: `app.ecu.profiles.honda_keihin_71_17`

```python
len(frame) == 24
frame[:4] == [0x02, 0x18, 0x71, 0x17]
sum(frame) % 256 == 0
expected_checksum = (-sum(frame[:23])) & 0xFF
```

This profile can normalize a 29-byte five-`FF`-prefixed frame to 24 bytes when
`allow_legacy_29_byte=True`. This is used by audit/profile training code and
tests; it is distinct from the current runtime RAW compatibility adapter.

## Time Semantics

The RAW adapter stores canonical `timestamp_ms` as:

1. the parsed JSONL timestamp if present, else
2. `frame_index * sample_interval_ms`, else
3. `frame_index * (1000 / sampling_rate_hz)`, else
4. `None` with sample-index time basis.

RAW session result `input.time_basis` is:

- `source_timestamp_ms` when JSONL supplied timestamps,
- `relative_time_ms` when `sample_interval_ms` is supplied,
- `sampling_rate_hz` when only sampling rate is supplied,
- `sample_index` otherwise.

## Parser Statistics

Both parsers return:

- `total_lines`
- `frames_found`
- `frames_parsed`
- `frame_errors`
- `checksum_valid_frames`
- `checksum_invalid_frames`
- `source_format`
- `timestamped_frames`

`source_format` is one of:

- `legacy_raw_text`
- `esp_jsonl`

## Explicit Non-Contracts

This repository does not prove support for:

- binary uploads,
- arrays of JSON objects,
- CAN frames,
- arbitrary OBD-II PID payloads,
- live UART/K-Line streams,
- Cloud-authenticated session envelopes,
- ESP firmware messages beyond the JSONL fields above.
