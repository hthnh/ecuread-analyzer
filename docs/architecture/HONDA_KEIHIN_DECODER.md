# Honda/Keihin Decoder Contract

Analyzer is the only ECU semantic decoder authority. Cloud and devices may move
RAW frames and canonical telemetry, but Honda byte offsets and formulas live in
this repository.

This repository contains two Honda/Keihin-related decoder paths. They must not
be conflated.

1. Current runtime RAW compatibility decoder:
   `app.ingestion.raw_ecu.decoder`, exposed through `app.ecu.decoder`.
2. Audited `0x71/0x17` profile decoder:
   `app.ecu.profiles.honda_keihin_71_17`.

New ESP production RAW decoding uses:

```text
legacy29_ff5 or native24_table17
  -> normalize to native 24-byte Table 0x17
  -> honda_keihin_71_17:1.0.0
  -> canonical-telemetry-v2
```

The old `honda_keihin_legacy_29` decoder remains only for historical API/file
compatibility. It must not be used as an independent semantic decoder for new
ESP production uploads.

Confidence labels in this document are restricted to:

- `VERIFIED`: code plus tests/calibration/evidence in this repository support the mapping.
- `PROVISIONAL`: implemented or high-confidence, but not fully verified.
- `UNKNOWN`: source bytes may be preserved, but physical identity/scaling is not proven or is contradicted.

## Historical Runtime Decoder: `honda_keihin_legacy_29:0.1.0`

Runtime provenance constants:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `ecu_profile_id` | `honda_keihin_legacy_29` |
| `decoder_id` | `honda_keihin_legacy_29` |
| `decoder_version` | `0.1.0` |
| Input frame | 29 bytes |
| Legacy prefix seen in fixtures | `FF FF FF FF FF` |
| Checksum | `sum(frame) % 256 == 251` |

Important behavior:

- `decode_frame` requires exactly 29 bytes.
- The legacy runtime decoder does not enforce the `02 18 71 17` header itself.
  Header/profile validation exists in the audited 24-byte profile module.
- Parsed frames with invalid checksums can still be decoded into rows, but
  `ml_eligible` requires both checksum validity and decoded signal validation.
- `validate_decoded_signals` checks configured physical ranges, not ECU profile
  identity.

### Historical Runtime Signal Table

Byte indexes below are zero-based indexes in the 29-byte legacy frame.

| Signal | Source byte(s) | Endian | Formula | Unit | Evidence | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rpm` | `b[9]`, `b[10]` | big-endian u16 | `(b[9] << 8) | b[10]` | rpm | Decoder code; `tests/test_decoder.py`; calibration report verifies normalized bytes 4-5. | VERIFIED |
| `tps_voltage` | `b[11]` | n/a | `b[11] * 5.0 / 256.0` | V | Decoder code; decoder tests; TPS sweep calibration verifies normalized byte 6. | VERIFIED |
| `tps_raw_candidate` | `b[12]` | n/a | `b[12]` | raw | Decoder code; canonical tests; TPS sweep calibration verifies normalized byte 7 as TPS raw. | VERIFIED |
| `battery_voltage` | `b[15]` | n/a | `b[15] / 10.0` | V | Decoder code; decoder tests; VOM calibration verifies normalized byte 14. | VERIFIED |
| `iat_c` | `b[16]` | n/a | `b[16] - 40` | degC | Decoder code; tests; calibration report marks normalized bytes 10-11 as IAT high-confidence. | PROVISIONAL |
| `ect_c_candidate` | `b[17]` | n/a | `b[17] - 40` | degC candidate | Decoder code and legacy tests preserve this value, but v0.2 calibration identifies normalized byte 13, not byte 12, as the engine-temperature byte. | UNKNOWN |
| `map_raw` | `b[18]` | n/a | `b[18]` | raw candidate | Decoder code and tests preserve this raw byte, but v0.2 calibration rejects normalized bytes 12-13 as MAP. | UNKNOWN |
| `signal_b19` | `b[19]` | n/a | raw byte | raw | Preserved by decoder only. | UNKNOWN |
| `signal_word_20_21` | `b[20]`, `b[21]` | big-endian u16 | `(b[20] << 8) | b[21]` | raw | Preserved by decoder only. | UNKNOWN |
| `signal_b22` | `b[22]` | n/a | raw byte | raw | Preserved by decoder only. | UNKNOWN |
| `signal_b23` | `b[23]` | n/a | raw byte | raw | Preserved by decoder only. | UNKNOWN |
| `signal_b24` | `b[24]` | n/a | raw byte | raw | Preserved by decoder only. | UNKNOWN |

### Runtime Validation Limits

Default limits from `app.config.SignalLimits`:

| Signal | Range |
| --- | --- |
| `rpm` | `0..16000` |
| `tps_voltage` | `0.0..5.0` |
| `tps_raw_candidate` | `0..255` |
| `battery_voltage` | `6.0..18.0` |
| `iat_c` | `-40..150` |
| `ect_c_candidate` | `-40..180` |
| `map_raw` | `0..255` |

## Audited Profile: `honda_keihin_71_17_v0.1` / `v0.2`

Module: `app.ecu.profiles.honda_keihin_71_17`

Frame contract:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Normalized frame length | 24 bytes |
| Header | `02 18 71 17` |
| Checksum | `sum(frame) % 256 == 0` |
| Checksum byte | `(-sum(frame[:23])) & 0xFF` |
| Optional legacy normalization | 29-byte frame with five leading `FF` bytes -> drop prefix |

The profile decoder returns structured fields with status metadata. It separates
structural validity from semantic confidence and keeps uncertain fields as raw
candidates.

Production API provenance is:

```text
ecu_profile_id = honda_keihin_71_17
decoder_id = honda_keihin_71_17
decoder_version = 1.0.0
telemetry_schema_version = canonical-telemetry-v2
```

| `checksum` | `b[23]` | n/a | two's-complement sum | byte | Checksum rule verified for valid frames. | VERIFIED |

### Production V2 Required Signals

The RAW JSON endpoint and Pi native adapter expose these canonical V2 core
signals:

| Signal | Source byte(s) | Formula |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rpm` | bytes 4-5 | big-endian u16 |
| `tps_voltage` | byte 6 | `raw * 5 / 256` |
| `tps_raw` | byte 7 | raw |
| `iat_c` | byte 11 | `raw - 40` |
| `ect_c` | byte 13 | `raw - 40` |
| `battery_voltage` | byte 14 | `raw / 10` |

V2 deliberately excludes `map_raw`, `ect_c_candidate`, and
`tps_raw_candidate` from the required/core schema. MAP actual location remains
unknown.

- `app/ecu/profiles/honda_keihin_71_17.py`

- `data/decoder-audit/profiles/honda_keihin_71_17_v0.2.json`

## Important Finding

The legacy canonical adapter still exposes V1 compatibility fields:

```text
rpm, tps_voltage, tps_raw_candidate, battery_voltage,
iat_c, ect_c_candidate, map_raw
```

The native Pi production adapter uses V2 fields:

```text
rpm, tps_voltage, tps_raw, battery_voltage, iat_c, ect_c
```

Production native provenance is `honda_keihin_71_17:1.0.0` with
`canonical-telemetry-v2`. V1 consumers must not assume `ect_c_candidate` or
`map_raw` has the same semantics as V2 `ect_c`.
